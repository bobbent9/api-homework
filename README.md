#### Budget Analysis: 

Throughout the months of February, March & April, the account spent over $10,000 per month.

Based on the projected income of $6085 annually, there is no way for this level of spending to be supported. 

The largest categories of transactions fall under Transfers and Payments.

#### Retirement Planning: 

The Alpaca API only provided the previous 100 prices for AGG and SPY which greatly impacted the results of the monte carlo simulations. Because of the historical recent market volatility and small dataset, the results predicted quite low returns. 

That said, our monte carlo simulations predicted that there is a significant dispersion of accounts that would be go to zero. Due to the volatility, there was also a chance of significant return as well.

The resulting prediction of the 4% withdrawal rate is understandably lacking. Due to such low returns, there would be no way to support the 4% withdrawal rate with such little portfolio growth.
